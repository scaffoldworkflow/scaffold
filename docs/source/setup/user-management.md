# User Management

Users can be created and managed through the Scaffold UI

Login as a use with admin privileges and then go to the `Users` tab and create a new user

Enter the user information that you want to create with any arbitrary group names (tied to workflow access) and the roles `read`, `write`, and `admin` as desired

# Getting Started

The following guide will get you up and running with a local instance of Scaffold and a basic workflow that you can execute.

In order to run this guide, you'll need the following:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

In this guide we assume that you have a basic understanding of using docker/docker-compose as well as knowing how to read and write YAML files
